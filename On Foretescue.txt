I didn't find any recent developments or news related to the Fortescue Principle. However, it's worth noting that the Fortescue Principle is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering and continues to be highly relevant in the field. This principle, which Charles LeGeyt Fortescue presented in a paper in 1918, demonstrates that any set of N unbalanced phasors (i.e., any polyphase signal) can be expressed as the sum of N symmetrical sets of balanced phasors, known as symmetrical components. This paper was judged to be the most important power engineering paper of the twentieth century​1​. Fortescue's contributions to electrical engineering are commemorated annually through a fellowship awarded by the IEEE​1​. Over his career, Fortescue also obtained 185 patents, with designs in transformers, insulators, and DC and AC power circuits​1​.
